# Email-Spam-Detection
## Introduction
Spam detection is one of the major applications of Machine Learning in the interwebs today. Pretty much all of the major email service providers have spam detection systems built in and automatically classify such mails as 'Junk Mail'.
In this project, we will be using Logistic Regression algorithm to create a model that can classify an Email as spam or not spam. Being able to identify spam emails is a binary classification problem as emails are classified as either 'Spam' or 'Not Spam'.
